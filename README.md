# acrostics
An acrostic factory.

While I was hospitalized in Seattle, I met a woman who taught me about acrostics, a manipulation of language whereby you find words that begin with the letters of a first word. 

In a previous instance, I've written a way to display acrostics, I'm afraid it is lost to history. But this version lets you easily create your own acrostics. 

It's written in AngularJS.
